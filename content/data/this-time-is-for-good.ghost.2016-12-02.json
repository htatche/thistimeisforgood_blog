Cambio ! \n*(Change ! Change !)*\n\nWe hear many guys yelling this word at the Avenida San Martin 1173, a busy avenue that crosses the pretty Mendoza, a city used by fellow travellers as a hub before crossing the Andes towards Santiago de Chile.\n\nSorting of your pocket money in Argentina can be a big nerve-breaking when you first land in the country, since it's not what you can call easy. The country defaulted *again* last summer, which translates to a bunch of very greedy and unfair politicians (nothing different here) announcing that there is no money left under the sheets to keep paying off their government debt. Hence, the Argentinian Peso (ARS) has suffered an ever-lasting devaluation for the misfortune of the argentinians, who see their savings drown in a terrible economic crisis.\n\nIn an attempt to stop this bleeding, the government pushed several laws over the past years. As a traveller or tourist they will cause you two major concerns:\n\n* It is forbidden to buy foreign currencies on the argentinian soil (not exactly, but it will be true for you as a foreigner).\n* The Argentinian peso exchange rate with other currencies is artificially maintained.\n\nAllright, now, the world is driven by dollars, the little green guys rule the economic exchanges between other nations, so if you are a citizen of Argentina and you own a business, you may also need to have some of them to buy your goods abroad. This is only one example, but the truth is that it's necessary to be able to pay in Dollars or Euros if you import. The solution ? There is no solution really, but a florishing market of currency exchange has popped out on the streets, this means that there is people that will happily (and illegaly), sell you Dollar/Euros, although the price that you will pay will be much higher than the ~~fake~~ official once.\n\nNow, the good news, is that this also works the other way round, so if before your arrival you take some time do do a few withdrawals to bring enough cash to this country you will be able to exchange them at a much higher rate than the one announced by the banks...and you better do, since this is what you have as of 15th of October 2014.\n\n* Official rate: 1 EURO = 10 ARS\n* Non-official rate: 1 EURO = 18.74 ARS\n\nYou get it, a total no-brainer, do not ever use an ATM to withdraw money or you will be utterly ripped-off. If you were clever enough and you crossed the border with cash, do not exchange it in a bank or an official exchange house. A [quick search on google](http://www.businessinsider.com/argentina-black-market-dollar-exchange-2013-6) will tell you what to do and how to get the best rate.\n\nAlso, pay attention to those two websites before buying pesos so you know if the situation at the moment is down or uptrend. For [Dollars](http://www.dolarargentino.com.ar/historico-dolar-blue.php), for [Euros](http://www.dolarargentino.com.ar/historico-euro-blue.php). (Check the second column, *Venta*, which means Selling)\n\nIn my case, as always, there was little to no anticipation, and my knowledge about the country was strictly limited to the city of Buenos Aires, the Iguazu falls, and the country's world-famous *Asados* . We arrive in Mendoza, we try to get money out of one of the ATM's in the bus terminal but none of our cards works (go figure). Thanks god, we were carring few dollars that we exchange downtown to pay for our first hostel stay, but now there's no cash left in our pockets, so I desperately start to search for a solution rather than receiving half of the money every time we will step in a bank.\n\nHere is what I found: there are two main companies that can sort you out. If you are American, look for [XOOM](https://www.xoom.com), and if you hold a bank account in the Euro zone, there is [Azimo](http://www.azimo.com).\n\nAzimo will not give you the rate one can find in the streets downtown, but it will still be much better than what you can get officially. The way it works is quick, hassle-free, and safe. Once you create an account with them, you will be asked to fill-in some personal data, and next you will be asked to scan your passport (they offer you straightaway to take a picture with your webcam, which is a big time saver). Once scanned, your passport will be automatically reviewed. Few seconds later you will be able to do your first transaction just using your debit card or by giving them your bank account if you preffer. Choose in which city you will pick up your money and then write the name of the receiver (yourself). [There are not many agencies across Argentina](https://azimo.com/en/send-money-to-argentina.html?sendingAmount=100&sendingCountry=IRL), most of them located in the capital Buenos Aires, so plan how much money you will need for your trip.\n\nOnce you've clicked the **Send Money** button, the website tells you that your transaction is being manually verified. No worries, it will take about 12 hours until you receive a mail saying that your money is ready for pick up. If ever it takes longer, you can send them an email, I did it the first time since I was in a real hurry and they replied and processed my transaction in less than half an hour (another reason to use their service).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W7AuaH79Jas/VFe_Wl8gnkI/AAAAAAAAItw/Ta31JmR_7bU/w859-h644-no/argenper.jpg)\n\nFinally, if you are in Mendoza, you'll be going to an agency called ARGENPER. Once there, just show your passport and transaction number. In less than 2 minutes you will be out, with a bunch of Pesos in your pocket (better to leave the place as soon as possible). It's worth saying that it can be quite busy until lunch time, so if you want to avoid queues try to go at around 13:00-14:00.\n\n","html":"<p>Cambio ! Cambio ! <br />\n<em>(Change !

When passing by the petrol station of *Santa Coloma* (not that I have to fill in any gas) a noise coming out of my highest gear is too loud to avoid hearing it. Stop. Take out my small repair kit, which contains a handful of handy tools, mainly screwdrivers and keys. Lie down besides the bike and start to inspect both derailleurs. \n\nEasy, doesn’t take me more than a minute to see that the chain is in full contact with the front derailleur in it’s highest gear. Having not taken enough time to actually see how this component works, I start playing straight away with a couple of screws plus an alien one. Being barely 20 minutes away from home I feel safe enough to break everything trying to fix it. This could easily be seen as a computer programmer approach towards learning. Just break that stuff down, try to fix it, and then feel accomplished for learning something new on that day. Dismount, mount, dismount, mount again. Bingo !\n\nBack on the road again riding down to *Sant Julia*, last village before the border, and also last Andorran style breakfast for me. Nothing fancy, a small ham&cheese sandwich accompanied by it’s “coffee with milk” (that’s not a Capucchino).\n\nI am doing it, I am crossing the Spanish border, the two policemans standing out ask me to stop, I get many questions coming out of their curious mind, but only one I will remember:\n\n-\t“So where are you going with this fully packed bike, dude ?”\n-\t“Well, I’ll try to get as close as possible to Poland, and then we'll fly to South America and see how it goes.”\n\nThey realize I am not joking, but it sounded like I was.\n\nOn the Spanish soil now. It’s happening ! Right here, right now.  Yiiihaaa ! \n\nMotorbikes doing their way to Andorra for a daylong trip are already on the road, those guys must woke up really early, so today I am not the only early bird. I want to salute them, but this time I am not wearing my leather jacket. Crap, here is my biker soul begging to lift my arm up while I make a *V* with my fingers, the bikers typical salute. \nAlso let me tell you that I tried to start up my engine when I was leaving after my breakfast, whatever. As a motorcycles fan myself I find it easy enough though to do this change of mind. I still have two wheels, but can’t rev up the thing with my wristle.\n\nMy new colleagues, on their power-less, silent, and un-revving machines, also salute me. They shake their head up and down, that’s all. My old friends are cooler, they make an effort, and they have a leather jacket, this makes you definitively more cool. Anyway, I’m sure they’re nice pals too.\n\n### Day 2\n\nA storm let an orchestra of storms and pissing rain fall out from the skype during the night, the tent did good but it is now soak on the outside. No time to let it dry out anyway, the first sun lights allow me to see a dense fog coming up from the bottom of the valley, plus Miquel, who the night before allowed me to pitch my tent on his green grass, warned me that the sprinklers were set to switch on at 7 am.\n\nHe wasn't kidding, while finishing to tighten a last knot to hold my backpack on the rack, an evil shower starts to heavily arose me but luckily enough my bike and me are already rushing out of that place.\n\nNo shortcuts available and more than four hundred meters of ascension are my big deal for today. My only way out of the Pyrenees, knowing that if I'm able to sort it through, my trip will become more realistic to my eyes. After all, at this point I am still playing to be a big boy.\n\nFew villages later, the fun is starting. On the lowest gear even a tractor is able to overtake me. That’s the first time it happens, what a moment, hopefully nobody was watching. Like a snail, at some point even my front wheel is sticking out of the gravel due to all the weight I carry behind. I don’t care. Keep going man, you will make it. Earplugs on now, with some silly and repetitive music. My player runs out of battery few minutes later.\n\n*Col de la Perche*, 1500 meters, congratulations to myself.\n\nWhat comes later was one of those crazy moments you get in your life, a steepy long road going down the hill for what it felt like hours, my best road to ride a motorcycle, and on my new toy it’s so much fun.\n\nThey are selling fruits and vegs half way, so I stop and have a couple of fresh peaches, plus for free a very nice conversation in a mix of french and frenchy catalan that belongs to these valleys. We talk about everything. There is no rush, no time being, not even a road or a bicycle. Just him and me. I listen while enjoying those juicy peaches.\n","html":"<h3 id=\"day1\">Day 1</h3>\n\n<p>I quit home at 6.30am and hop on the main road heading South, the first mechanical annoyances don't take long to come out.

My player runs out of battery few minutes later.</p>\n\n<p><em>Col de la Perche</em>, 1500 meters, congratulations to myself.</p>\n\n<p>What comes later was one of those crazy moments you get in your life, a steepy long road going down the hill for what it felt like hours, my best road to ride a motorcycle, and on my new toy it’s so much fun.</p>\n\n<p>They are selling fruits and vegs half way, so I stop and have a couple of fresh peaches, plus for free a very nice conversation in a mix of french and frenchy catalan that belongs to these valleys. We talk about everything. There is no rush, no time being, not even a road or a bicycle. Just him and me. I listen while enjoying those juicy peaches.</p>","image":"http://i.imgur.com/h0pfikX.jpg","featured":false,"page":false,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-11-14T18:51:37.249Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-11-14T19:07:05.593Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2014-11-14T18:52:00.671Z","published_by":1},{"id":5,"uuid":"03724d4d-c426-461d-8aeb-174bae361559","title":"Going beyond in Les Corbieres (Cycling trip in France II)","slug":"going-beyond-in-les-corbieres-cycling-trip-in-france-ii","markdown":"###Day 3\n\nOn the 14th of July 1789 the French people won the revolution against the wealthiest and the highest society classes, they also decided that his day had to be reminded every once in a year and thus made it a national day off.

This time location was better, and wanted to do it again to fight my fears, even thought I knew that there would be no problems, imagination often takes over our minds and makes us fear the unknown, and the known as well.\n\nBefore my trip I went for a hike in *Ariege*, a beautiful region in the *French Pyrenees* that I will not recommend to anybody since it’s wild, harsh, empty of human beings in some places, and I don’t want you to go because I want to keep it like this forever. Even though the hike was expected to last for 4 days, I had to sign for retreat on the first day after crossing a high pass and having to walk on a deep and melting snow for hours. That sort of end of May that feels like February in the mountains. After walking daylong I preferred to stop and sleep right before the village. It was on steep slope full of isards that were observing me as I was getting in their territory. A gorgeous view over a lake and the end of the valley would be my perfect spot to take out my bivouac bag that night. \n\nBy the end of a rainy night, I took out my head from the bag and saw a very dense fog around 100m above me, meaning that it was definitively time to descend to the village. Suddently I heard stones falling off from the slope on my right side. \n\n*- There you go, those mountain goats are already awake*\n\nBut those animals don’t growl, and right there a big piece of animal was grumbling to show his presence off. I still didn’t know if I had dreamed it or it was for real, but then I heard that thing a second time a little bit closer.\n\n*- What…the…heck*\n\nThe border between being safe or not is thin, mostly people think they are safe when they actually only feel they are. At this moment I knew I wasn’t safe, but neither was I even feeling safe. Only human being at the wrong place and at the wrong moment, plus at the wrong time of the year. Bears wake up hungry during spring after hibernation looking forward to feed their empty stomachs. My heart rate was on fire and there was no way to calm it down, I tried to think, maybe it was a wild dog ? Maybe, but then that dog had to weight more than 200 kg, anyhow it was definitively a hell of a big animal, and after wild pigs there is only one other sort of wild being that you really do not want to be close to it.\n\n*- He runs faster than me, he climbs, and he swims, and he can also easily rip off my head, don’t try anything*\n\nI was lying down in a plastic bag, wearing my boxers and a t-shirt, and what sounded like a teddy bear in my outdoors bedroom. This is what I call having a bad time.\n\nLater on I heard some goats running up the top of the slope.
